    "As already noted in the introduction (see {ref}`section-2`), the use of a version control system like Git  can be seen as both a powerful and user-friendly mechanism to stabilize “living” corpora. However, “programmable” corpora consist of a connection of data (\"living corpus\") with a lightweight research software (in the form of a research-driven API) whereby this connection can be conceptualized as a distributed research infrastructure in a dynamic digital ecosystem (cf. {cite:t}`boerner_2023_report`). Such a research infrastructure can no longer be stabilized only via the versioning mechanism of Git, since in addition to the two components (data, code), their specific connection is also crucial for the possibility of reproducing the research conducted with it. For such scenarios, as will be shown below, a container-based approach is suitable, whereby we will rely on containerization using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is inspired by the concept of research artifacts from computer science, which is described by Arvan et al. as “self-contained packages that contain everything needed to reproduce results reported in a paper\" and which are also \"typically self-executable, meaning that they are packaged within a virtual machine \\[…\\] or within a container\" {cite:p}`arvan_2022_reproducibility`. The prototypical implementation, on which we will report in the following, is again based on the Drama Corpora Platform, DraCor. In a DraCor-based experiment, we set ourselves the challenge of making a network-analytic study, which we conducted for a paper publication, as fully replicable as possible using Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The containerization technology \"Docker\" is widely used in the IT industry, because it can speed up development cycles and can reduce overhead when deploying applications. Especially in the field of “DevOps” – “Dev” for development and “Ops” for operations, which refers to the processes that are necessary to have an application run on a server – the importance of communication between the development and the operations team is considered highly important. Thus Docker workflows have been introduced. They do not only streamline communication processes, they also shift the responsibility of handling software dependencies to the development team: Docker enables the people actually writing the application to specify the environment in which their software should be run. There are a couple of key components to such workflows: The so-called “Dockerfile”[^dockerfile] is a meaningful and executable form of documentation. It contains the steps necessary to build a highly portable, self-contained digital artifact, a “Docker image”[^dockerimage]. These images can be easily deployed on a designated infrastructure as “Docker containers”[^dockercontainer].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dockerfile]: In the [glossary](https://docs.docker.com/glossary) available as part of the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) the Dockerfile is explained as such: “A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.” [https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#dockerfile); also see the [documentation of the Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile).\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dockerimage]: “Docker images are the basis of containers. An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime. An image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other. An image does not have state and it never changes.” [https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#image](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#image) \n",
    "\n",
    "[^dockercontainer]: see [https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#container](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#container).\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, in CLS research projects we will rarely find teams of development and operation professionals that are in need of communicating better. But, we would like to argue that still the attempt of reproducing research could be framed in a similar sense: On the one hand we have an individual researcher (or a team of researchers) that conducts a study. In our analogy, these are the developers. Their product – a study – relies on some application or script that operates on data. On the other hand we have researchers wanting to reproduce or verify the results, similar to operations professionals that have to deploy someone else's application on a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes evident that some hurdles in the process of reproducing CLS research exist due to a lack of clear communication on how to run the analysis scripts and a tendency to offload the responsibility of setting up an environment in which the analysis could be executed to the reproducing party. A containerized research environment might circumvent these problems: Instead of claiming that scripts “work, at least as of today” on the machine of the developing researcher, as for example, Andrew Piper writes it in his foreword to his book “Enumerations” {cite:p}`piper_2018_enumerations {xii}`; when employing container technology, it could be guaranteed instead that a container created from an image containing a runnable self-contained research environment can be re-run. This would allow for a reproduction of the study. Instead of saying: The analysis was run-able on my machine when writing the paper and publishing the code only, in addition a researcher could provide a run-able research artifact alongside the study. When using Docker, this could be one or more images that would allow to re-create the research environment the study was conducted in.[^open_container_initiative]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^open_container_initiative]: On a side note and because someone might argue that by embracing a proprietary technology: “Linux containers” – what Docker is at its core – as a technology have been available since 2008. “Docker” was only introduced in 2013 and the company Docker Inc. actively promoted the “Open Container Initiative” (OCI, see [https://opencontainers.org](https://opencontainers.org)), which was started in 2015. It developed a vendor agnostic specification of containers and images, that was released in 2017 to which the current Docker implementation adheres. This, of course, still doesn’t guarantee the longevity of the technology, but at least a total lock-in into a certain technology is circumvented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will report on our exemplary experiment in making a CLS study replicable by using Docker technology.[^graz_presentation]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^graz_presentation]: This experiment has also been presented at the “DH2023” conference in Graz. Cf. {cite:p}`boerner_2023_dockerizing`. See also the [slides of the presentation](https://zenodo.org/records/8183676).

    "We exemplify the benefits of a Docker-based research workflow by referring to our study “Detecting Small Worlds in a Corpus of Thousands of Theater Plays” {cite:p}`trilcke_2024_small-worlds`. In this study, we tested different operationalizations of the so-called “Small World” concept based on a multilingual “Very Big Drama Corpus” (VeBiDraCor) of almost 3,000 theater plays. As explained above, the corpora available on DraCor are “living corpora” – which means that both the number of text files contained and the information contained in the text files changes (e.g. with regard to metadata or mark-up). This poses an additional challenge for reproducing our study. Furthermore, our analysis script (written in R) retrieves metadata and network metrics from the REST API of the “programmable corpus”. Thus, we had to devise a way of not only stabilizing the corpus but also the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "DraCor provides Docker images for its services, which are, at its core the API, a frontend, a metrics service, that does the calculation of the network metrics of co-presence networks of the plays, and a triple store. The ready-made Docker images can be used to set up a local DraCor environment.[^dracor_docker_images]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dracor_docker_images]: Docker images of the DraCor system components are published on the platform [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dracor). More recent images are `dracor/api` ([Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dracor/api/tags)), `dracor/frontend` ([Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dracor/frontend/tags)), `dracor/metrics` ([Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dracor/metrics/tags)) and `dracor/fuseki` ([Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dracor/fuseki/tags)). These images are used in the production infrastructure and ideally should be used when setting up local instances as well. For reasons of allowing for replication of work that has, for example, been presented at the DH 2023 Graz conference, the image repositories with the naming convention that repeats “dracor” in the image name, e.g. `dracor/dracor-api` ([Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dracor/dracor-api/tags)) are still kept on the platform."

There are multiple steps involved to set-up the locally running infrastructure some of which need to be run from the command line. In addition, one has to create a bare container with a database and an API, populate it with the data, conduct the analysis, create several Docker images, and, ultimately, publish them in a repository, e.g. on DockerHub. There is also the need to create the Docker Compose file that specifies which system components are needed to recreate the environment the analysis was run in at different points in time. Thus, there is a considerable need to make the process more user-friendly."

    "“StableDraCor” supports creating a Docker image from a populated database container. With the original workflow it was necessary to do this with the `docker commit` command in the terminal. It was also necessary to provide additional documentation, for example the Jupyter notebook that was used to assemble a corpus. This information was ‘detached’ from the Docker image and it was necessary to explicitly point to this form of documentation, because it was not part of the research artifact itself. We tackled this issue with StableDracor and found a way to include machine readable documentation *about* the research artifact directly *attached* to it. Now, when we create an image with the tool, we issue a slightly different `docker commit` command that also attaches Docker Object Labels[^docker_object_labels] directly to the newly created image. We achieve this by taking the manifest as mentioned earlier, and decomposing it into single Docker Labels. StableDraCor can convert a manifest into labels but also re-convert Docker Object Labels on the image in the `org.dracor.stable-dracor.*` namespace back into a manifest. By providing the manifest information as image labels, we allow a user, for example, to retrieve information about the corpus contents and the sources of a database without having to run the image as a Docker container first. We also attach the information about the individual DraCor microservices directly to the image as labels.\n",

The original DLINA corpus contained 465 plays taken from the TextGrid Repository. As the corpus archeology (see {ref}`excursus_major_revisions`) has shown there were several significant changes to the encoding which would result in the early added data not being compatible with the current versions of the DraCor API. Still, it might be an interesting use case to repeat earlier studies of the DLINA collective on the basis of a recent version of the data. Therefore, the following code samples demonstrate how a GerDraCor-based DLINA corpus can be built in a local DraCor setup. It will include all 465 plays originally included in the DLINA corpus, but in the versions as are included in the latest GerDraCor."
